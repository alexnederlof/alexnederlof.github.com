{% img pull-right img-responsive col-md-4 http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ebb9e4a763c8416dda5e02529ea0157.png?s=250 %}I'm a Software Engineer working at [Magnet.me](http://magnet.me), lead developer of the [Crawljax](http://crawljax.com) project and a part-time researcher at [Delft University of Technology](http://tudelft.nl), where I also got my masters degree in Computer Science. 

In this blog I share my experiences in the tech field in the hope that somebody else can benefit from it as I benefit from the many other tech blogs out there.

You can also read about me on my [Open Source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/alexnederlof), or find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/alexnederlof), [GitHub](https://github.com/alexnederlof) and [LinkedIn](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/alexnederlof).
